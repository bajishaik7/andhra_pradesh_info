Palaeolithic (old stone age) implements have been found, suggesting that man then roamed the region. The Kingdom of Prataliputra (5th century BC)}, identified with Bhattiprolu, appears to be the earliest known kingdom in Guntur District. Inscriptional evidence shows that king Kubera was ruling over Bhattiprolu around 230 BC followed by the Sala Kings. Guntur was successively ruled by famous dynasties such as the Satavahanas, Ikshavakus, Pallavas, Anandagothrins, Vishnu Kundins, Chalukyas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Reddies, Vijayanagara and Kutub Shahis during ancient and medieval times. Later, several subordinate kingdoms ruled the region. These subordinate dynasties also indulged in mutual wars, one of which culminated in a famous battle of Palnadu which is enshrined in legend and literature as “Andhra Kurukshetra” in 1180 AD.",
